## Welcome Tetrisito 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RegalonaManda/Tetrisito/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

This is our end of the year project in which we will build a tetris (or maybe pac-man) clone. Most importantly, [yo mama](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/030/873/Screenshot_20.jpg).

We will recreate the gameplay and art and, if we have time, add features of our own.

### Yeezus

### Jekyll Themes
